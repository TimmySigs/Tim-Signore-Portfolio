# Tim Signore's Portfolio


- As a developer who is still at the the start of thier journey, I wanted to make a portfolio to help improve my skills and eventually show them off in the future!


- Along the way I realised I did not know CSS as well as I thought I did, and had many challenegs geting everything to deploy correctly.  

- In the future i'd like to clean the page up and maybe experiment with a more modern look.
